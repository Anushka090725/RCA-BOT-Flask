Pods killed with "OOMKilled" status are terminated due to memory limits being exceeded.
Troubleshooting:
1. Check `container_memory_usage_bytes`.
2. Inspect workload memory patterns.
3. Increase memory limits in pod spec if justified.

Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to inspect termination reason.
