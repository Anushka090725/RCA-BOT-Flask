High CPU usage on a pod often indicates resource-intensive workloads. Check for:
1. Infinite loops or unbounded tasks.
2. Spikes in incoming traffic.
3. Lack of CPU limits in pod spec.

Prometheus metric to monitor: `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`.
Thresholds above 0.85 (85%) over a minute usually indicate CPU saturation.
